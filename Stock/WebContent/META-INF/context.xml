   <!--Dennis Mathew: The contents of this file have to be put into the deployment server Tomcat\conf\context.xml
   This file is not included in the deployment war file.
   Explaination:
   If this file is included in the deployment war file then the contents of this file is copied to tomcat\conf\Catalina\localhost\ccrs2_webservice.xml 
   If that file is manually modified then ideally the file should not be overwritten by tomcat for future deployments but it appears that atleast some version of tomcat have a bug where the ccrs2_webservice.xml is always overwritten incase of a new deployment.
